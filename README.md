# higdon
Convert Hal Higdon running plans to metric. A Chrome extension.

## What does it do?

The extension adds a "Convert to km" link below each training plan on http://www.halhigdon.com. The link toggles the training plan between miles and km.

## How to install and use it?

- Download and extract the zip file (https://github.com/mattkj/higdon/archive/master.zip)
- In the chrome address bar type *chrome://extensions*
- Drag and drop the *higdon* folder on to the page
- Visit any of the training plans at http://www.halhigdon.com/training/ and the conversion link will automatically appear below the table

## Compatibility

Due to the sheer number of training programs and inconsistant formatting, *higdon* only works fully with some training programs.
